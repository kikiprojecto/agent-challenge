# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Docker Build via GitHub Actions

## ✅ Your Code is Pushed!

Your enterprise-grade backend is now on GitHub. The Docker image will be built automatically by GitHub Actions.

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### **1. Set Up Docker Hub Secrets** (REQUIRED)

Go to your GitHub repository and add Docker Hub credentials:

**URL**: https://github.com/kikiprojecto/agent-challenge/settings/secrets/actions

Click **"New repository secret"** and add:

1. **Secret 1**:
   - Name: `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - Value: `kikiprojecto` (your Docker Hub username)

2. **Secret 2**:
   - Name: `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
   - Value: Your Docker Hub password or [access token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)

---

### **2. Trigger the Build**

#### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
The workflow runs automatically on every push to `main`. Since you just pushed, check:

**URL**: https://github.com/kikiprojecto/agent-challenge/actions

You should see a workflow running called "Build and Deploy to Nosana"

#### Option B: Manual Trigger
1. Go to: https://github.com/kikiprojecto/agent-challenge/actions
2. Click "Build and Deploy to Nosana" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select `main` branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

---

### **3. Monitor the Build**

1. Go to: https://github.com/kikiprojecto/agent-challenge/actions
2. Click on the running workflow
3. Watch the build progress (takes ~5-10 minutes)
4. ✅ Success = Docker image is on Docker Hub!

---

### **4. Verify the Image**

After the build succeeds, verify the image is on Docker Hub:

**URL**: https://hub.docker.com/r/kikiprojecto/neurocoder-ai

You should see:
- Tag: `v1`
- Tag: `latest`
- Size: ~400-500 MB

---

### **5. Deploy to Nosana**

Once the Docker image is built, deploy to Nosana:

```powershell
npx @nosana/cli job post `
  --file ./nos_job_def/nosana_mastra.json `
  --market nvidia-3090 `
  --network devnet `
  --timeout 30
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Secrets not found" Error
- Make sure you added `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets
- Check spelling (case-sensitive)
- Wait 1 minute after adding secrets, then re-run workflow

### Build Fails
- Check the Actions logs for specific errors
- Verify Dockerfile exists in repository
- Ensure package.json has all dependencies

### Can't Access Docker Hub
- Create account at https://hub.docker.com/signup
- Create access token at https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
- Use token instead of password in GitHub secrets
